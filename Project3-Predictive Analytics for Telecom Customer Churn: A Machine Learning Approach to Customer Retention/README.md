I developed a robust customer churn prediction system for a telecom company, leveraging advanced machine learning models and comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to identify key factors influencing customer retention.
1. Comprehensive EDA for Feature Insights: The project began with a thorough EDA to uncover patterns and correlations between customer behavior and churn. Techniques like correlation heatmaps and pairplots were employed to visualize relationships between features such as contract renewals, customer service calls, and account weeks. This enabled the identification of key factors driving customer churn, offering actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.
2. Efficient Data Preprocessing and Feature Scaling: I handled data preprocessing with precision, ensuring that categorical and continuous features were cleaned, encoded, and scaled appropriately using StandardScaler. I ensured that both models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) were trained and tested on properly normalized data, leading to accurate, generalized predictions.
3. Training Multiple Models: To optimize the system's performance, I trained both a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest classifier. The Random Forest model, due to its ability to handle feature importance and interactions, demonstrated a higher predictive accuracy, predicting customer churn.
4. Real-World Application for Telecom Customer Retention: Feature importance analysis revealed that the top factors contributing to customer churn were Day Minutes and Monthly Charges, followed by Customer Service Calls. This suggests that high service usage, frequent customer support calls, and billing issues drive customer dissatisfaction. To prevent churn, telecom companies can consider offering tailored plans with usage alerts and improved customer support experience to reduce the likelihood of users reaching out multiple times due to service issues.
