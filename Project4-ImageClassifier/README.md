As an ML Intern at Digital Empowerment Network, I successfully developed an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here's a summary of how the task was accomplished:

1. *Data Preprocessing & Augmentation*: Employed data normalization, resizing, and extensive augmentation (rotation, flipping, cropping) to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.
2. *Model Architecture*: Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over 50 epochs, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization for improved model robustness.
3. *Performance Metrics*: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%, with a precision score around 83%, using the validation set for fine-tuning and evaluation.
4. *Predictions*: The model efficiently classified images into 10 categories, with high reliability on unseen test data, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling diverse visual patterns.
