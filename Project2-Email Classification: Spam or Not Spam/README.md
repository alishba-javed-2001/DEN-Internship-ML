Developed an email classification system to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails, aimed at improving email management and security. This project, assigned by Digital Empowerment Network, utilized a CSV dataset from Kaggle.
1. For data handling and preparation, I processed the CSV dataset by dropping irrelevant columns and handling categorical features. Tokenization was applied to convert email text into numerical features, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was used to vectorize the text data, effectively capturing the significance of words in the context of email classification.
2. In terms of modeling, I employed two key algorithms: Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVC). Naive Bayes was chosen for its effectiveness in handling text data where word frequencies play a crucial role, assuming feature independence. SVM with a linear kernel was utilized due to its robust performance in high-dimensional spaces, finding the optimal hyperplane for classification. Both models required careful feature scaling and probabilistic output handling to enhance performance.
3. The evaluation process involved computing various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to gauge model effectiveness. To visualize and interpret the results, I generated confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations provided clear insights into the models' performance and their capability to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.
4. Industrial Application: The developed classification system is crucial for automating email filtering, thereby enhancing email security and efficiency. By reducing the need for manual email management, this technology contributes significantly to improving productivity in organizational settings.
