Developed and evaluated a machine learning model to predict house prices using a combination of Linear Regression and XGBoost Regressor. The project involved comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

Key Achievements:
1. Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Successfully handled missing values and converted categorical variables to numerical formats. Utilized OneHotEncoding for categorical features and StandardScaler for numerical features.
2. Model Development: Implemented Linear Regression and XGBoost Regressor models, leveraging pipelines for streamlined preprocessing and model training.
3. Performance Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score. Achieved significant insights into model accuracy and effectiveness.
4. Visualization: Created detailed visualizations including scatter plots and residual plots to compare actual vs. predicted values and analyze model residuals.
5. Correlation Analysis: Conducted a heatmap analysis to understand feature correlations and their impact on price prediction.
